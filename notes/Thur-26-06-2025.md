JAVA 
Interpreted -means reduced compilation time.
ECMAScript- to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers.
Multiparadigm- the ability to use different programming styles, such as procedural or object-oriented programming.
Data types in JS and Concatination.
Different methods of JV. like(length,toUprcase,toLowercase,split,Concatination, index).
Arrays - Variable that hold multiple values. In Array learn(push,op,idex)
Objects-An object is a collection of key-value pairs. It allows you to store multiple values in one variable using a structured format.
const person = {
  name: "Hina",
  age: 22,
  isStudent: true
};
Loop-A loop is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times â€” automatically, without writing it again and again.
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hina");
}
let i = 1;
while (i <= 3) {
  console.log("Hi " + i);
  i++;
}

| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `for`        | Run code a specific number of times    |
| `while`      | Run code **while** a condition is true |
| `do...while` | Like `while`, but runs at least once   |
| `for...in`   | Loop through **object keys**           |
| `for...of`   | Loop through **arrays or strings**     |
